# URL phising detection ML based Application
- Machine Learning-based URL Detection: URL Alert is a machine learning model designed to detect phishing URLs by analysing their behaviour. The project aims to explore various machine learning models and perform Exploratory Data Analysis on a phishing dataset to understand the features that significantly influence the models' ability to identify safe and phishing URLs.
- Importance of Features: Through the analysis, it was found that certain features such as "HTTPS," "AnchorURL," and "WebsiteTraffic" play a crucial role in accurately classifying whether a URL is a phishing URL or not. These features have been identified as having higher importance in determining the safety of URLs.
- Accuracy and Model Evaluation: Different machine learning models, including Gradient Boosting Classifier, Decision Tree, and KNN, are applied to the dataset to evaluate their accuracy in detecting phishing URLs. The Gradient Boosting Classifier achieved an accuracy of 0.974, recall of 0.994, and precision of 0.986. Comparisons are made among the models to determine their performance and suitability for the task.
- Technology Stack: The project utilises various technologies and libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn to develop and implement the machine learning models, perform data analysis, and evaluate the accuracy of the models.
